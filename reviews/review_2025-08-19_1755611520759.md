### File-by-File Review

**File:** `server/src/routes/upload.route.js`
**Line(s):** 1-13
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY / LOGIC
  **Description:** The previous high-priority security issue regarding the missing `verifyJwtToken` middleware on the `router.get("/")` route (line 12) has been successfully addressed in this pull request. The route is now correctly protected, which is excellent.

  However, this route file currently defines endpoints only for file upload (`POST /`) and listing (`GET /`). A comprehensive file management system typically requires additional functionalities such as deleting and downloading files. The absence of dedicated routes for these operations represents a functional gap in the API design. While not a bug in the existing code, their omission will prevent the full implementation of client-side features (e.g., "Delete" or "Download" buttons) and makes the API incomplete for a complete file management solution.

  **Line(s) to Fix:** N/A (requires adding new routes)
  **Current Code:** (No existing code for file deletion or download routes)
  ```javascript
  import express from "express";
  import {
    handlePdfUpload,
    getUploadedFiles,
  } from "../controllers/upload.controller.js";
  import { upload } from "../services/multer.service.js";
  import { verifyJwtToken } from "../middlewares/auth.middleware.js";

  const router = express.Router();

  router.post("/", verifyJwtToken, upload.single("pdfFile"), handlePdfUpload);
  router.get("/", verifyJwtToken, getUploadedFiles);
  export default router;
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:** Add dedicated routes for file deletion and download. These routes should also be protected by the `verifyJwtToken` middleware to ensure proper authorization. This will likely involve importing additional controller functions (e.g., `deleteFile`, `downloadFile`).

  ```javascript
  import express from "express";
  import {
    handlePdfUpload,
    getUploadedFiles,
    // Add these imports if controller functions exist:
    // deleteFile,
    // downloadFile,
  } from "../controllers/upload.controller.js";
  import { upload } from "../services/multer.service.js";
  import { verifyJwtToken } from "../middlewares/auth.middleware.js";

  const router = express.Router();

  router.post("/", verifyJwtToken, upload.single("pdfFile"), handlePdfUpload);
  router.get("/", verifyJwtToken, getUploadedFiles);
  // Add new routes for complete functionality:
  // router.delete("/:fileId", verifyJwtToken, deleteFile);
  // router.get("/download/:fileId", verifyJwtToken, downloadFile);
  export default router;
  ```
  **Priority:** MEDIUM
