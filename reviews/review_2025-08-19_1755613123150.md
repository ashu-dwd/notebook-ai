**Line(s):** 6
- **Issue Type:** STYLE
  **Description:** This line contains commented-out debug code. It's good practice to remove such lines before merging into the main branch to keep the codebase clean and avoid confusion.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 6
  **Current Code:** `//console.log(token);`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Remove this line`
  **Priority:** LOW

**Line(s):** 15
- **Issue Type:** STYLE
  **Description:** This `console.log` statement is debug output that should not be present in production code. It adds noise to server logs and can potentially expose internal data if not handled carefully in a public-facing environment.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 15
  **Current Code:** `console.log("in mid", req.user);`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Remove this line`
  **Priority:** LOW

**Line(s):** 19-21
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** When a token verification fails for reasons other than expiration, the server currently returns a generic "Invalid token" message to the client. While this is good for security (not exposing internal errors), the actual `error` object received in the `catch` block contains valuable debugging information. Logging this error on the server-side will greatly assist in diagnosing and troubleshooting issues related to token validation without affecting the client's response.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 19-21
  **Current Code:**
  ```javascript
      if (error.name === "TokenExpiredError") {
        return res.status(401).json({ success: false, error: "Token expired" });
      }
      return res.status(401).json({ success: false, error: "Invalid token" });
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
      if (error.name === "TokenExpiredError") {
        return res.status(401).json({ success: false, error: "Token expired" });
      }
      // Log the actual error for server-side debugging
      console.error("JWT verification failed:", error.message || error);
      return res.status(401).json({ success: false, error: "Invalid token" });
  ```
  **Priority:** MEDIUM

**File:** server/src/utils/jwtMaker.js

**Line(s):** 23
- **Issue Type:** BUG/LOGIC
  **Description:** This line (`return token;`) is unreachable code because the function has already returned on the preceding line (line 22: `return { accessToken, refreshToken };`). Furthermore, the variable `token` is not defined anywhere in the scope, which would result in a `ReferenceError` if this line were ever reached. This indicates a logical error or a remnant of previous development that should be removed.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 23
  **Current Code:** `return token;`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Remove this line as it's unreachable and incorrect.`
  **Priority:** HIGH

**Line(s):** 25-26
- **Issue Type:** BUG/MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** The `try...catch` block around JWT signing currently only logs the error to the console (`console.log(error);`) but does not re-throw it or return an explicit error indicator. This means that if token creation fails for any reason, the `createJwtToken` function will implicitly return `undefined` to its caller without signaling the failure. This can lead to silent failures and hard-to-debug issues elsewhere in the application. For robust error handling, the function should either re-throw the error or return a specific error object/null to indicate failure. Additionally, `console.log` should generally be replaced with `console.error` for error logging, and ideally, logging mechanisms like Winston or Pino should be used in production environments instead of raw `console` statements.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 25-26
  **Current Code:**
  ```javascript
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error creating JWT token:", error);
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to ensure calling functions handle the failure
      // Alternatively, return null or an error object if the caller is designed to check return values:
      // return null;
    }
  ```
  **Priority:** HIGH

**Overall Review Summary:**
- **Total Issues Found:** 5
- **Critical Issues:** 2 (Unreachable code and silent failure on error in `jwtMaker.js`)
- **Code Quality Score:** 7/10
- **Approval Status:** NEEDS_CHANGES
- **Key Recommendations:**
    1.  **Critical Fix:** Resolve the unreachable code and silent error handling in `server/src/utils/jwtMaker.js` to prevent hidden bugs.
    2.  **Cleanliness:** Remove all debug `console.log` statements and commented-out code from `auth.middleware.js` and `jwtMaker.js`.
    3.  **Error Visibility:** Implement server-side logging for generic JWT verification errors in `auth.middleware.js` to aid in debugging without exposing internal details to clients.
    4.  The overall structure and intent of the middleware and utility function are clear, but the identified issues impact reliability and maintainability.
