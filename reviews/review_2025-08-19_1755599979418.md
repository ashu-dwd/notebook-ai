**Overall Review Summary:**
- **Total Issues Found:** 8
- **Critical Issues:** 1 (Security)
- **Code Quality Score:** 5/10
- **Approval Status:** NEEDS_CHANGES
- **Key Recommendations:**
    1.  **Critical Security Fix**: Implement robust password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) before storing user passwords.
    2.  **Architectural Refinement**: Refactor the generic `runQuery` function into more specific, intent-driven database interaction methods (e.g., `selectOne`, `selectAll`, `runCommand`) to improve clarity, prevent brittle logic, and enhance maintainability.
    3.  **Database Optimization/Best Practice**: Review and remove redundant `AUTOINCREMENT` keywords from SQLite table definitions where `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` is sufficient.

### File-by-File Review

**File:** `server/src/database/sqlLite.db.js`

**Line(s):** 4
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** The database file path is hardcoded directly in the source code. This makes it inflexible for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) where different database instances or paths might be required.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 4
  **Current Code:** `export const db = new Database("mydb.sqlite");`
  **Suggested Fix:** `export const db = new Database(process.env.DATABASE_PATH || "mydb.sqlite"); // Use environment variable for configuration`
  **Priority:** MEDIUM

**Line(s):** 5
- **Issue Type:** STYLE / MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** Logging the exact database path using `console.log` on every application startup can be considered noisy, especially in production or containerized environments where instances might start and stop frequently. For better log management, consider using a dedicated logging library with configurable log levels.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 5
  **Current Code:** `console.log(`Database path: ${\"mydb.sqlite\"}`);`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Consider integrating a proper logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) or remove this for production readiness.`
  **Priority:** LOW

**Line(s):** 8, 19, 30
- **Issue Type:** STYLE
  **Description:** Comments are written in Hindi. While this might be understandable by the current team, for broader collaboration, open-source projects, or future maintainers, English is the universally accepted standard for code comments in professional development. Consistency in language improves readability and maintainability.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 8, 19, 30
  **Current Code:**
  ```javascript
  // Agar table pehle se nahi hai to ek dummy bana dete hain
  // Agar query SELECT hai to all() ya get() use karenge
  // INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ke liye run()
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
  // If the table does not exist, create it
  // For SELECT queries, use all() or get()
  // Use run() for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries
  ```
  **Priority:** MEDIUM

**Line(s):** 11, 23, 33
- **Issue Type:** PERFORMANCE / LOGIC
  **Description:** In SQLite, a column defined as `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` automatically implies `AUTOINCREMENT` behavior, where it becomes an alias for the internal `ROWID` and is guaranteed to be unique and increasing. Explicitly adding `AUTOINCREMENT` adds a small overhead (slower performance, larger database files) by preventing the reuse of ROWIDs from deleted rows. It is rarely needed unless specific requirements dictate strict non-reusing of IDs (e.g., for syncing with external systems).
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 11, 23, 33
  **Current Code:**
  ```sql
  userId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  chatId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  fileId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```sql
  -- For userData table
  userId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  -- For chats table
  chatId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  -- For files table
  fileId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  ```
  **Priority:** MEDIUM

**Line(s):** 14
- **Issue Type:** SECURITY
  **Description:** Storing user passwords directly as plain text (`password TEXT NOT NULL`) is a critical security vulnerability. If the database is ever compromised, all user passwords would be exposed, leading to severe risks like identity theft and credential stuffing attacks. Passwords must always be hashed using a strong, one-way, and computationally expensive hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) before storage.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 14
  **Current Code:** `password TEXT NOT NULL,`
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```sql
  -- The database schema itself might not change the `TEXT` type, but the
  -- *application logic* must ensure that a strong hash of the password
  -- (e.g., bcrypt hash) is stored here, not the plain text password.
  -- Example of how the column should be conceptually used:
  password TEXT NOT NULL -- This column must store strong password hashes (e.g., bcrypt), NOT plain text!
  ```
  **Priority:** HIGH

**Line(s):** 18
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** There's inconsistent logging for table creation. Only the "Users table created or already exists." message is logged, while similar messages are missing for the "Chats" and "Files" tables. For better clarity and debugging during application startup, it's good practice to consistently log the status of all significant initialization steps.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 18
  **Current Code:** `console.log("Users table created or already exists.");`
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
  console.log("Users table created or already exists.");
  // Add similar logs for other tables for consistency:
  // console.log("Chats table created or already exists.");
  // console.log("Files table created or already exists.");
  ```
  **Priority:** LOW

**Line(s):** 40-44
- **Issue Type:** LOGIC / MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** The `runQuery` function attempts to be generic but uses brittle string-matching (`.startsWith("select")` and `.includes("limit 1")`) to determine the database operation (single row, multiple rows, or command). This approach is fragile; it can break with slightly different query formatting, comments in SQL, or more complex subqueries. It violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Database interaction logic should be clear and intent-based, not inferred from string parsing.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 40-44
  **Current Code:**
  ```javascript
    if (sql.trim().toLowerCase().startsWith("select")) {
      if (sql.toLowerCase().includes("limit 1")) {
        return stmt.get(params); // single row
      }
      return stmt.all(params); // multiple rows
    }
    // ...
    return stmt.run(params);
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
  // Break down the generic 'runQuery' into more specific, intent-based functions:

  export function selectOne(sql, params = []) {
    try {
      const stmt = db.prepare(sql);
      return stmt.get(params); // Fetches a single row
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Database selectOne failed:", error); // Use console.error for errors
      throw new ApiError(500, "Database selectOne failed", [error.message]);
    }
  }

  export function selectAll(sql, params = []) {
    try {
      const stmt = db.prepare(sql);
      return stmt.all(params); // Fetches multiple rows
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Database selectAll failed:", error);
      throw new ApiError(500, "Database selectAll failed", [error.message]);
    }
  }

  export function runCommand(sql, params = []) { // Renamed from runQuery for clarity on its purpose
    try {
      const stmt = db.prepare(sql);
      return stmt.run(params); // Executes INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Database command failed:", error);
      throw new ApiError(500, "Database command failed", [error.message]);
    }
  }
  // Remove the original generic runQuery function, or simplify it to only handle run() if needed,
  // then ensure all callers use the appropriate new function (selectOne, selectAll, runCommand).
  ```
  **Priority:** HIGH

**Line(s):** 47
- **Issue Type:** STYLE
  **Description:** Commented-out code, like `//console.log(stmt.run(params));`, should generally be removed before merging code to the main branch. It adds clutter, can confuse future readers about its purpose, and version control (Git) is designed to keep a history of changes, making commented-out code redundant.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 47
  **Current Code:** `//console.log(stmt.run(params));`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Remove this line.`
