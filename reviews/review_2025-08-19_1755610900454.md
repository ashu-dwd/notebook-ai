**File:** server/src/services/chromadb.service.js
**Line(s):** 66
-   **Issue Type:** STYLE/MAINTAINABILITY
    **Description:** There is a `console.log` statement used for debugging purposes. This should be removed from production code to avoid unnecessary console output and potential exposure of sensitive information. For logging in a production environment, consider using a dedicated logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) configured with different log levels.
    **Line(s) to Fix:** 66
    **Current Code:** `console.log(typeof embedding);`
    **Suggested Fix:** `// console.log(typeof embedding); // Remove or replace with a proper logger`
    **Priority:** MEDIUM
