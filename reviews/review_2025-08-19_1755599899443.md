**Overall Review Summary:**
- **Total Issues Found:** 9
- **Critical Issues:** 1 (Security)
- **Code Quality Score:** 6/10
- **Approval Status:** NEEDS_CHANGES
- **Key Recommendations:**
    1.  Implement password hashing before storing them in the database.
    2.  Refactor `runQuery` into more specific database interaction functions (e.g., `selectOne`, `selectAll`, `runCommand`).
    3.  Address the use of `AUTOINCREMENT` in SQLite table definitions.

### File-by-File Review

**File:** `server/src/database/sqlLite.db.js`

**Line(s):** 2
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** The `ApiError` import is not used anywhere in this file. Unused imports reduce code readability and can be misleading.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 2
  **Current Code:** `import ApiError from "../utils/ApiError.js";`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Remove the import if not used, or ensure it's used if intended for future logic.`
  **Priority:** LOW

**Line(s):** 4
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** The database file path is hardcoded. For better flexibility and environment-specific configurations (e.g., a test database vs. production database), this path should ideally be configurable, perhaps via environment variables.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 4
  **Current Code:** `export const db = new Database("mydb.sqlite");`
  **Suggested Fix:** `export const db = new Database(process.env.DATABASE_PATH || "mydb.sqlite");` (Requires setting `DATABASE_PATH` in your environment or a config file).
  **Priority:** MEDIUM

**Line(s):** 5
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** Logging the database path on every application startup can be noisy, especially in production environments where startup might happen frequently or for scaled instances. It's generally better to use a proper logging library and configure log levels.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 5
  **Current Code:** `console.log(`Database path: ${"mydb.sqlite"}`);`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Consider using a logging library (e.g., Winston, Morgan) with configurable levels, or remove for production.`
  **Priority:** LOW

- **Issue Type:** STYLE
  **Description:** The comments are in Hindi. While this might be acceptable for internal team use, for wider collaboration or open-source projects, English is the standard. Consistency in language is important for maintainability.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 8, 19, 30
  **Current Code:**
  ```javascript
  // Agar table pehle se nahi hai to ek dummy bana dete hain
  // Agar query SELECT hai to all() ya get() use karenge
  // INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ke liye run()
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
  // If the table does not exist, create it
  // Use all() or get() for SELECT queries
  // Use run() for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries
  ```
  **Priority:** MEDIUM

**Line(s):** 11, 23, 33
- **Issue Type:** PERFORMANCE / LOGIC
  **Description:** In SQLite, `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` alone makes the column an alias for `ROWID` and automatically auto-increments. Adding `AUTOINCREMENT` imposes a slight overhead by preventing the reuse of ROWIDs from previously deleted rows and ensures strictly increasing IDs, which is rarely needed and can lead to faster exhaustion of available ROWIDs. It's often omitted unless a specific requirement dictates it.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 11, 23, 33
  **Current Code:**
  - `userId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,` (Line 11)
  - `chatId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,` (Line 23)
  - `fileId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,` (Line 33)
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```sql
  -- For userData table
  userId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  -- For chats table
  chatId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  -- For files table
  fileId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  ```
  **Priority:** MEDIUM

**Line(s):** 14
- **Issue Type:** SECURITY
  **Description:** Storing user passwords as plain text (`password TEXT NOT NULL`) is a severe security vulnerability. Passwords must always be hashed using a strong, slow hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) before being stored in the database. This protects user accounts in case of a data breach.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 14
  **Current Code:** `password TEXT NOT NULL,`
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```sql
  -- Database schema change is required, e.g., to store hashed passwords.
  -- The application code responsible for user registration/login must implement hashing.
  password TEXT NOT NULL, -- This line itself is fine, but the *value* stored must be a hash.
  -- A comment should be added to emphasize this:
  -- password TEXT NOT NULL -- Store hashed passwords, not plain text!
  ```
  **Priority:** HIGH

**Line(s):** 18
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** Only the "Users table created or already exists." message is logged, but not for the "Chats" and "Files" tables. For consistency and clarity during application startup, all table creation messages should be logged, or none at all.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 18
  **Current Code:** `console.log("Users table created or already exists.");`
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
  console.log("Users table created or already exists.");
  console.log("Chats table created or already exists.");
  console.log("Files table created or already exists.");
  ```
  **Priority:** LOW

**Line(s):** 40-44
- **Issue Type:** LOGIC / MAINTAINABILITY
  **Description:** The logic to determine if a query is a `SELECT` query based on `startsWith("select")` and then further checking `includes("limit 1")` is brittle. This approach can lead to incorrect behavior if SQL queries become more complex (e.g., with CTEs, comments, or formatted differently) or if a `LIMIT 1` is part of a subquery. It's better to explicitly differentiate between "get one row" and "get all rows" functions based on the *intent* of the caller, not a string match.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 40-44
  **Current Code:**
  ```javascript
    if (sql.trim().toLowerCase().startsWith("select")) {
      if (sql.toLowerCase().includes("limit 1")) {
        return stmt.get(params); // single row
      }
      return stmt.all(params); // multiple rows
    }
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:**
  ```javascript
  // Instead of a single generic runQuery, consider separate functions:
  export function selectOne(sql, params = []) {
    try {
      const stmt = db.prepare(sql);
      return stmt.get(params);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error); // Use console.error for errors
      throw new ApiError(500, "Database selectOne failed", [error.message]);
    }
  }

  export function selectAll(sql, params = []) {
    try {
      const stmt = db.prepare(sql);
      return stmt.all(params);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw new ApiError(500, "Database selectAll failed", [error.message]);
    }
  }

  // The existing runQuery would then only handle INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
  export function runCommand(sql, params = []) { // Renamed for clarity
    try {
      const stmt = db.prepare(sql);
      return stmt.run(params);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw new ApiError(500, "Database command failed", [error.message]);
    }
  }
  // The original runQuery can then be simplified, or the above specific ones used.
  ```
  **Priority:** HIGH

**Line(s):** 47
- **Issue Type:** STYLE
  **Description:** The commented-out `console.log` indicates that it was used for debugging. Such commented-out code should generally be removed before merging to keep the codebase clean. If it's useful, it should be properly managed with a logging system.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 47
  **Current Code:** `//console.log(stmt.run(params));`
  **Suggested Fix:** `// Remove this line.`
  **Priority:** LOW
