**Overall Review Summary:**
- **Total Issues Found:** 2
- **Critical Issues:** 1 (Missing authentication for file listing endpoint)
- **Code Quality Score:** 7/10
- **Approval Status:** NEEDS_CHANGES
- **Key Recommendations:**
    1.  **Implement Authentication for File Listing:** The `GET /` route currently lacks `verifyJwtToken` middleware, allowing unauthenticated access to file metadata. This must be secured immediately.
    2.  **Expand API for Full File Management:** To support complete client-side functionality for a file management system, consider adding dedicated API routes for file deletion and download.

### File-by-File Review

**File:** `server/src/routes/upload.route.js`
**Line(s):** 12
- **Issue Type:** SECURITY / LOGIC
  **Description:** The `router.get("/")` route, which is intended to fetch uploaded files, is missing the `verifyJwtToken` middleware. This poses a critical security risk as it allows any unauthenticated user to retrieve information about uploaded files, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure. For consistency and security, access to user-specific data should always be authenticated.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** 12
  **Current Code:**
  ```javascript
  router.get("/", getUploadedFiles);
  ```
  **Suggested Fix:** Apply the `verifyJwtToken` middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access their uploaded files.
  ```javascript
  router.get("/", verifyJwtToken, getUploadedFiles);
  ```
  **Priority:** HIGH

**Line(s):** N/A (Requires adding new lines)
- **Issue Type:** MAINTAINABILITY / LOGIC
  **Description:** This route file currently defines endpoints for file upload and listing. However, a complete file management system typically requires functionality for deleting and downloading files. The absence of these routes indicates a functional gap in the API design. While these are new features and not a direct bug in the existing lines, their omission will prevent the full implementation of client-side features like a "Delete" button or a "Download" button for files.
  **Line(s) to Fix:** N/A (requires adding new routes)
  **Current Code:** (No existing code for file deletion or download routes)
  **Suggested Fix:** Add dedicated routes for file deletion and download. This would involve importing corresponding controller functions (e.g., `deleteFile`, `downloadFile`) and defining new `router.delete` and `router.get` endpoints, ensuring they are also protected by `verifyJwtToken`.
  ```javascript
  // Example for new routes (assuming controller functions are implemented elsewhere):
  // import { deleteFile, downloadFile } from "../controllers/upload.controller.js"; // Add to existing imports

  // ... existing routes ...

  // router.delete("/:fileId", verifyJwtToken, deleteFile);
  // router.get("/download/:fileId", verifyJwtToken, downloadFile);
  ```
  **Priority:** MEDIUM
